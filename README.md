# Thailand 2024

Girl's trip to Thailand, visiting Chieng Rai, Chieng Mai and Bangkok. We have been planning this ever since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown so it has taken almost 2 years to fruition!

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

In addition, each trip will be stored as a separate repository in the
`travelens` organization. This project integrates all the individual
repositories into a single seamless website.
