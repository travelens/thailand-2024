After vising the long necked Karen village, we were hungry but our driver was keen to make a start heading back to Chiang Mai.

We ended up stopping for a late lunch at a delightful small restaurant called Chan Chai (ร้านอาหารจันทร์ฉาย อ.เวียงป่าเป้า เชียงราย), 383/2 หมู่ 2 ติดโรงรับจำนำทางทิศเหนือ เวียง Wiang Pa Pao District, Chiang Rai - [Facebook Page.](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ร้านอาหารจันทร์ฉาย-เวียงป่าเป้า-เชียงราย/289378341213035) The owner here is also the head waiter and the chef, so it was a small operation.

We had some very good dishes, in fact some in the group felt at the end of the trip that it was the best meal we had. We had seafood tom yum, a deep fried fish dish, omelette and stir fried morning glory. I liked the giant teddy bear on the couch as we entered the restaurant.

On the way back to Chiang Mai after lunch, we passed by a giant golden statue of a famous local Buddhist monk. I am guessing this is Kruba Srivichai, the patron saint of Lanna.
