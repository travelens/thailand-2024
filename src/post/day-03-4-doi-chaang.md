Doi Chaang is a venture partnering with the Akha hill tribe farmers of Northern Thailand in the Doi Chang village producing single origin specialty coffee beans and they have a cafe located next to their premises on the way to Chiang Rai called [DOI CHAANG Caffè - สาขาเชียงราย](https://doichaangcoffee.co.th/en/).

Upon entering, we were greeted with a garden featuring a fountain and the building itself is reminiscent of tribal houses.

The menu here is international, but we ordered mainly Thai dishes. Mine was a seafood krapao. The coffee here was without surprise delicious.
