Where we stayed in Chiang Rai - it's called [Grow Home-Stay and Space โรงแรมโกรวโฮม](https://www.facebook.com/growhomestayandspace/) and it's a trendy creative boutique hotel with communal living space and a studio and performance area so you can indulge in your creative expression should you have the urge.

Downstairs appeared to be some sort of child care centre, the mid level has the kitchen and small library, the upper floor are where the rooms and, and finally the rooftop contains a studio and performance space.

I shared a large king sized bed with Margaret in the two bedroom apartment, and Cat slept in the separate room with one bed.
