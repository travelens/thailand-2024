Nimman is a trendy neighbourhood in Chiang Mai full of unique shops, galleries, boutique accommodation and eating places. It is full of young students and digital nomads due to its proximity to Chiang Mai University. We wandered around the lanes and passed by Gotham (a trendy restaurant) and Art Mai Gallery (a boutique hotel).

As it was Sunday, we browsed through the “White Market” at Nimman Soi 1- formed by the gathering of Japanese people living in Chiang Mai Province. Predictably this is full of cute trinkets and clothes.

We ended up at [One Nimman](https://www.onenimman.com/about/), a trendy mall at Nimmanhaemin Soi 1 full of lifestyle retailers and design studios. There is a clocktower located in the square in front of the mall which is full of food stalls.

Lastly, we stopped by at [MAYA](https://mayashoppingcenter.com) and browsed through some of the shops there.
