Today is the first day of our private tour of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, organised by [Chiang Mai Private Tour Guide and Driver](https://www.facebook.com/chiangmaiprivatetourguide). Our tour guide is called Wanchai Yoonuch but he asked us to call him "Patter". He picked us up around 8AM in the morning, and the first thing we asked him was to take us to breakfast.

We all wanted to eat congee, so he took us to a restaurant called [Jok Somphet Restaurant โจ๊กสมเพชร](https://www.facebook.com/joksomphet/).

I had the seafood congee here, it was delicious, and we shared a few plates of dim sims. Nearby was a shop selling fried doughsticks (called Youtiao or yau char kway) and they had a Big Youtiao in front.
