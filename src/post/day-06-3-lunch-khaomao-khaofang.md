[Khaomao Khaofang Restaurant](http://www.khaomaokhaofang.com/?lang=en) (ข้าวเม่า-ข้าวฟ่าง ป่าในจินตนาการ) has been awarded a Michelin hat for 2020-2023. Upon arrival, we are immediately greeted with the exquisite scenery of a rainforest creating an unparalleled atmosphere of an “imaginary jungle”. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with various kinds of flowers and shrubs along with an enormous roaring waterfall. The toilet here has to be seen to be believed, I really feel like I am peeing in the jungle and washing my hands in a waterfall.

We had a variety of dishes here, including sweet rice paper rolls with pork, crab omelette, steamed squid roe in spicy lime soup, stir fried soft shell crabs in yellow curry sauce, and stir fried chayote with oyster sauce.
