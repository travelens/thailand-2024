[99 The Heritage Hotel](https://www.99theheritagehotels.com) is a luxurious boutique hotel that somehow reminds me of the Raffles in Singapore of the Peninsula in Hong Kong. Exuding old world charm and elegance, we posed for a few photos here. Next time I visit Chiang Mai, I would not mind staying here! It opened in 2016 and has 26 rooms over 2 floors.
