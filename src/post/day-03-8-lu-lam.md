[Lulum Restaurant Chiang Rai ร้านอาหาร​ หลู้ลำ เชียงราย](https://www.facebook.com/RanXaharHluLaCheiyngray/) is a well known riverside restaurant serving Northern Thai food located next to the Kok River in Chiang Rai. We arrived there around 8PM, and the staff told us the kitchen was closing in around 30 mins so we had to order quickly.

I found the food here was okay, but maybe a bit too pungent and "one note" for my liking, but the riverside view was fantastic and the restaurant glittered at night.
