After visiting the Thai Silk Village, we headed to the picturesque traditional village of Mae Kampong, nestled amongst the hills at an altitude of 1300m. We stopped at Kao Ba Fuaeng (เก๊าบ่าเฟือง แม่กำปอง) - [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100094923366006), which had two storeys. We ate at the upper storey, and had some Thai sausages, chicken wings and thighs to share, and then had bowls of noodles. Mine is a version of kuay chap but with glass noodles. From the upper storey of the restaurant, we could see a good view of the main street below us.
