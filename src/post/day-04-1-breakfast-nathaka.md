We woke up early, and checked out of the hotel and back on board the van. Patter, our driver, took us to a place called Nanthaka Rice Porridge (โจ๊กหม้อดินเชียงราย - นันทกา) - [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/JokeMorDin) สี่แยกขัวดำ เยื้องโรงเรียนสามัคคีฯ, Chiang Rai.

I had the "Emperor" porridge here, which contains a bit of everything, so it was a good feed. THe porridge was certainly very tasty!

The restaurant is across the road from [Wat Ming Muang วัดมิ่งเมือง](https://www.templeseeker.com/wat-ming-muang-elephant-temple-chiang-rai/) temple, which looks almost like a Hindu temple. Unfortunately, we did not have time to visit this temple, so I just took some photos from across the road.
